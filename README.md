# Noise-Filtration-Station
this code is meant to be a low/high pass filter with variable cutoffs
you can see the input and output spectrograms with the spectrogram.m outputs
the audio can be read as a recording, like in the file, or it can be ripped from a small wav file
there is also a graph of the magnitude response curve of the filter the user can create, which is not necessarily a LPF or HPF curve.
